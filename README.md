Coursera Data Science - Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Course Project

This repository contains the project files submitted by FKurzhals for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Data Science course, including steps to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset.

Dataset and Source:
- Human Activity Reconition - Data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
- Site - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
- Downloadable files - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Contents:
- CodeBook.md - A code book describing relevant information about the changes  made to the original data as well the steps taken for cleaning and tranforming the dataset.

- run_analysis.R - The R script created for getting, cleaning and transforming the original files into a tidy dataset. The submitted scrit needs to accomplish the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
